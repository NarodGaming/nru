# Narod Resolution Utility (NRU)

NRU is a utility which helps to make registry edits, to allow resolutions on monitors which do not support Custom Resolutions through NVIDIA control panel.

## Requirements

- A NVIDIA GPU
- A supported monitor:
  - Odyssey G9
  - Odyssey Neo G9
- Windows 7, 10 or 11.

## Helpful Notes

- The above requirements are automatically checked for you.
- Some manual setup is also required, the utility will walk you through these steps.

## Features

With NRU, you can:

- Add new resolutions (2560x1440, 3440x1440 & more).
- Remove any previously added custom resolutions.

## Limitations

- NVIDIA resets this on driver updates, so you'll need to run the utility again.
- Multiple monitors may cause issues. NRU will walk you through steps to prevent this, but you can also temporarily unplug them.
- NRU is in it's infancy - it may not work for you right now, but this will be continually improved upon.

## Helping NRU

NRU is fully open-source. It is licensed under GPLv3. Right now, we're looking for help with:

- Any issues/bugs found
- Improving compatibility with more systems
- Improving compatibility checks
